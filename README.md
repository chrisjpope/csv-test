# csv-test
project originally began as a way to understand how to upload and use a csv of data. It has since morphed into an attwmpt to use D3.js as a tool.

I intend to explore further how a csv may be altered simply, or whether it is possible to upload a new csv to replace an old obe.

## D3.js
I have attempted to understand how to use D3.js by using a simple dataset and attempting to plot some of the data. The plots and graphs created are present on github pages at https://chrisjpope.github.io/csv-test.

##Dataset
I have used a simple dataset of brownfield land register data from a council. The data contains 27 rows of brownfield sites with various attributes.

##Charts
Added in a scatterplot using information from [D3 Graph Gallery](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/scatter_basic.html) and csv data in repo.
